# Automatic Motion Teacher

This project is a end-to-end automatic motion teaching system. There are two components: a *Workflow Compiler*, which accepts target motions in a raw format, extracts motion information, and generates a schematized lesson; and a *Web Frontend*, which displays the lesson in a web-based user interface.

## Installation & Usage
The installation processes are described in a readme associated with each component.
* [Workflow Compiler](workflow-compiler/workflow-compiler.md)
* [Web Frontend](web-frontend/web-frontend.md)
